My name is Aigerim Kurmasheva and I am a 4th year student studying Political Science and International Relations at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan. My major emphasizes the development of analytical, methodological, and applied skills to nurture mature and competent individuals that can function not only in governmental and legal careers, but also in the private sector. I am definitely going for an offer at local embassies that exist in Astana in order to apply my knowledge and make any improvements into the current political system.

            </li>
 	<li>

            </li>

<h3>Hong Kong 2017</h3>
      <p>
       In 2017 me and my other classmates who knew English at Advanced level from my school traveled to Hong Kong in 2017 in order to present a project about underwater wind turbines and system which supposedly would generate energy from the power of waves. We had presented the project at a local summer school for Hong Kong kids at a science exhibition.
      </p>
<h4>EXPO Astana 2017</h4>
    <p>
       I also had a practice of translation while working at one of the EXPO organizations and translating the guests' request for our local Kazakh workers. I practiced this for full 3 months of summer.
      </p>
<h5>WORK and TRAVEL 2022</h5>
    <p>
       In addition to my translation experience, I wanted to improve my stress-resistance skills and to see if I am able to withstand climate change, atmosphere and home vibe change. In order to get adapted to the situation fully I had to shift my mindset to American one which was indeed needed in the United States. I have lived in States for about 3-4 months and experiences culture shock and had a chance to analyze the difference between the government and banking system in the States and Kazakhstan.
